PixelFlux is a pixel-art sprite editor. It has been designed specifically for creating pixel-art for games and apps. It seems like all fully featured editors are either pay-for or add supported and, if you have used any of them then you will understand the frustration.

As a budding game developer I needed a simple source of game content. For POCs samples when working independently it doesn't make sense to pay for professional apps and free versions can be very frustrating. This is why PixelFlux was born.

PixelFlux is built with FluxUI. And experimental JS UI interface that I am working on in tandem with PixelFlux. The FluxUI should be portable and, once cleaned and tidy, will become a separate entity in itself.
