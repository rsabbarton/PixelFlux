  <a href="https://pixelflux.me">Pixelflux.me</a> is a private project created by the author alone.  
  At present there is no business association with the website and it is entirely free to use.  
  This does not mean that privacy is not a key part of the project and preserving
  user privacy is a consideration in all development decisions.

  Pixelflux captures only information available in your public profile and stores only your email address and profile image URL.
  This is captured so that images and data created using pixelflux.me can be saved on our server and returned to from another location by logging in
